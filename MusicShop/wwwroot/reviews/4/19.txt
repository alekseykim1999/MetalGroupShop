In 2010 Igor Butman Orchestra featuring renowned NY 
jazz artists Sean Jones, Kathy Jenkins, Peter Bernstein and James 
Burton presented crossover program “Sheherazade’s tales” at “Cherry Forest” 
festival in Moscow. The program included Nikolay Levinovsky’s jazz arrangements 
of Russian romances and symphonic suite “Sheherazade” by N.A.Rimsky-Korsakov.  
It’s no surprise that such original fusion of classic and jazz music became a 
revelation for audience and mass media, because hardly anyone connected such 
polar musical worlds with such ingenuity before. Live album “Sheherazade’s 
tales had been recorded at the concert and was releaseв at Butman Music 
Records this November.
