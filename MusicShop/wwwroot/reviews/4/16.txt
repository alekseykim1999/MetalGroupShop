As an admirer of big bands all over the world, I've waited years to hear a 
well-endowed, swinging ensemble from Russia, and here at last it is, charging boldly into the 
labyrinthine Eternal Triangle behind its charismatic leader, tenor saxophonist Igor Butman.
Butman is a jazz superstar in his native country, and his band is so highly regarded that 
it was invited by none other than Wynton Marsalis to share the stage with the Lincoln 
Center Jazz Orchestra to open the JALC concert season in September '03. Butman's ensemble 
more than held its ground that evening, and now, more than three years onward, comes its 
debut recording, and to note that it affirms the band's prowess would be understating the case.

Ben Ratliff, who covered the JALC performance for The 
New York Times, compared Butman as an improviser to Marsalis, 
but I'll go him one better. To me, he sounds much like a Russian version of the late great 
Tubby Hayes, and to readers in Great Britain, there could be few more favorable 
comparisons. Those in the States should think Jimmy Heath with traces of James
Moody, Hank Mobley, George Coleman and even Stan Getz.

Butman, as resourceful a composer as he is a player, 
wrote seven of the album's nine numbers; the other two are 
Sonny Stitt's "Triangle and Vitaly Dolgov's "Bolero. The arrangements, all 
by Dolgov, are invariably bright and engaging. Besides the "Bolero, there's 
a graceful "Waltz for Oksana, a charming "Samba de Igor, a debonair "Blues of 
a Tired Man, a lyrical "French Connections, a genial salute to "Strange and 
Beautiful Siberia, and a pair of exuberant flag-wavers, "Bulit and "Falling Out.


The clear and inescapable verdict is that this is an outstanding band, Butman is a 
forceful and inventive player, and The Eternal Triangle is a consistently sharp and rewarding album.
