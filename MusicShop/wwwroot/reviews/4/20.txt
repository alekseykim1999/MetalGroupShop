Butman Music Records presents a sensational album "Special Opinion" by Nick Levinovsky, 
Igor Butman and Moscow Jazz Orchestra! Levinovsky and the Orchestra showed their great 
crossover experiment on their previous album, and now it's time for jazz-rock combustion! 
The fourth album in the Orchestra's discography, Special Opinion was recorded in New York 
in January 2013 with fusion and jazz rock super stars: drummer Dave Weckl, guitarists 
Mike Stern and Mitch Stein, saxophone player Bill Evans, trumpeter Randy Brecker and 
bassist Tom Kennedy.

New music that Nick Levinovsky wrote for this album represents a fiery 
resistance between two elements: jazz orchestra on one front, a rock band 
on another.
Light and subtle textures,  tremendous swing and mighty breathtaking unison 
run from one side,  aggressive groove,  killing rock rhythm section and earthy 
sound from another.

Special Opinion was presented in Moscow in November 2013 by Nick Levinovsky, Igor 
Butman and Moscow Jazz Orchestra featuring very special guests: Victor Bailey on bass, 
David Fiuczynksi on guitar and Joel Rosenblatt on drums!
