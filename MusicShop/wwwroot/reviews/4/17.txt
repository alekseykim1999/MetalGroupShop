For the New Year Igor Butman has prepared an amazing gift for all jazz fans 
- the album "Winter's Tale" (Butman Music Records)! The album was recorded by 
the Moscow Jazz Orchestra under the direction of the maestro with the participation 
of the best young vocalists - Oleg Akkuratov, Victoria Kaunova and Yaroslava 
Simonova. On the album everyone's favorite Russian and American songs alternate, 
with which the most awaited holidays of the year are associated. Thus, the popularly 
beloved "Three White Horses" and "If there was no winter" organically coexists on the 
album with "White Christmas" 
and "Jingle Bell Rock", intertwining two cultures in a whirlwind of New Year's music. 
In a word, a festive mood will be provided for you!
