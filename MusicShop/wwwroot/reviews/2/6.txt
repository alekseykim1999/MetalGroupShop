In 1945, Frank Sinatra recorded his first album after a career previously devoted solely 
to single records. Over two sessions, he performed the eight songs included in The Voice of 
Frank Sinatra, which Columbia released as a four-LP set of 78-rpm records on March 4, 1946. 
The collection quickly topped the then-recently established Billboard album chart. The Voice 
of Frank Sinatra was a precursor to the "concept" albums Sinatra would pioneer at Capitol 
eight years later, a carefully chosen and arranged selection of songs creating a specific mood. 
In this case, arranger/conductor Axel Stordahl used a string quartet and a rhythm section, with 
occasional added instruments, to create settings for a group of classic ballads, all from the '20s 
and '30s. Sinatra took the material very seriously, singing the love lyrics with utter sincerity. 
His singing and the classically influenced settings gave the songs an unusual depth of meaning.
