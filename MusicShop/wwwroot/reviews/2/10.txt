"Close to You" is one of Frank Sinatra's most gentle and intimate albums, and that 
is due in no small part to the Hollywood String Quartet, which forms the core of 
the album's instrumental support. It also was one of the most difficult to record, 
taking eight months and five different sessions. Certainly, it is one of the most 
unusual and special of Sinatra's albums, featuring a subdued and detailed performances 
that accentuate both the romantic longing and understated humor of the numbers, which 
are mainly torch songs. With the quartet's support, the album comes closer to sounding 
like a classical album, like a pop variation on chamber music. Where the intimacy of In 
the Wee Small Hours sounded confessional and 
heart-broken, Close to You has a delicate, lovely quality; it may not be seductive, but it is charming and romantic.
