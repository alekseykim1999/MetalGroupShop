Originally released as a set of multiple 78s, "Christmas Songs" by Sinatra contains 
a number of holiday standards Frank Sinatra recorded for Columbia Records during the 
'40s. Recorded with arranger Axel Stordahl, the songs are lush and gentle, underscoring 
the warmth in Sinatra's voice. Much of this music is wonderful and a worthwhile addition 
to any Sinatra collection, even if it doesn't contain any revelations or truly classic performances.
