Pairing Dizzy Gillespie with Cuban arranger/composer Chico O'Farrill 
produced a stunning session which originally made up the 
first half of a Norgran LP. O'Farrill conducts an expanded orchestra 
which combines a jazz band with a Latin rhythm section; among the 
participants in the four-part "Manteca Suite" are trumpeters Quincy 
Jones and Ernie Royal, trombonist J.J. Johnson, tenor saxophonists 
Hank Mobley and Lucky Thompson, and conga player Mongo Santamaria. 
"Manteca," written during the previous decade, serves as an exciting 
opening movement, while the next two segments build upon this famous 
theme, though they are jointly credited to O'Farrill as well. 
"Rhumba-Finale" is straight-ahead jazz with some delicious solo 
work by Gillespie. A later small-group session features the trumpeter 
with an all-Latin rhythm section and flutist Gilberto Valdes, who 
is heard on "A Night in Tunisia" and "Caravan." Both of the Latin 
versions of these pieces are far more interesting than "Con Alma," 
as the excessive percussion and dull piano accompaniment add little 
to this normally captivating theme. Long out of print, this 2002 
CD reissue will only be available until May 2005; it is well worth acquiring.
