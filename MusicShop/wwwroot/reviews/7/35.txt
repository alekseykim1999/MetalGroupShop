It is such a pity that Dizzy Gillespie Philips' LPs have 
yet to be reissued on CD, for the trumpeter (45 at the 
time of this recording) was at the peak of his powers in 
the early '60s. On such songs as "In a Shanty in Old Shanty Town",
"Careless Love," "One Note Samba" and the "Theme from Black Orpheus", 
Gillespie and his expanded quintet (with guests Bola Sete or Elec Bacsik 
on guitar and Charlie Ventura taking a memorable bass 
sax solo on "No More Blues-Part II") 
show a great deal of spirit and creativity. Leo Wright 
(on alto and flute) and pianist Lalo Schifrin are also in fine form throughout this gem.
