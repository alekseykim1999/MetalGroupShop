Dizzy Gillespie was recruited as a special 
guest to perform on March 13, 1955, in concert 
with the Orchestra (a Washington, D.C., big band), a 
date that was recorded by Bill Potts and not initially 
released until 1983 by Elektra Musician. Although there was 
only a brief rehearsal of Gillespie with the band 
prior to their performance of the 
trumpeter's "The Afro Suite" (which includes "Manteca" 
plus a trio of pieces written in collaboration with Chico 
O'Farrill), they provide excellent support for this 
extended work, which features the composer extensively. 
Two pieces from the vast repertoire of Count Basie, 
"Hobnail Boogie" and "Wild Bill's Boogie," are enjoyable, 
though pianist Larry Eanet suffers from an inadequate microphone 
setup. Ed Dimond takes over the keyboard for an explosive 
Latin-flavored romp through "Caravan," though Gillespie 
obviously steals the show. The rather reserved small group 
rendition of "Tin Tin Deo" is curious but still of interest. 
The closer is bassist Tom McKay's swinging riff tune "Up 
'N' Downs," which sounds like it could have easily been 
a part of Basie's songbook. One oddity about the concert 
is that Charlie Parker had died during the previous night, 
but this was not known to the musicians as his passing had 
not yet been announced. One of the more obscure recordings 
by Dizzy Gillespie, One Night in Washington is well worth acquiring.
