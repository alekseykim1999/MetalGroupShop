Dizzy Gillespie's globetrotting big band of 1956-1957 
was one of his finest groups, a very exciting orchestra 
that at various times had such players as trumpeters Gillespie, 
Joe Gordon, and Lee Morgan, trombonists Melba Liston and Al Grey, 
altoists Phil Woods and Ernie Henry, the tenors of Billy Mitchell, 
Ernie Wilkins, and Benny Golson, and pianists Walter Davis, Jr. 
and Wynton Kelly. With arrangements contributed by Quincy Jones 
(who was in the trumpet section), Wilkins, Liston, and Golson, 
this was a classic orchestra. Its three studio albums plus a few 
numbers previously issued only on samplers and nine previously 
unreleased performances (mostly alternate takes) are on this wonderful 
two-CD set. The high points are many, including 
"Dizzy's Business," "Jessica's Day," "The Champ," 
"Cool Breeze," "Birks Works," "Whisper Not," "Stablemates," and "I Remember Clifford." Essential music.
