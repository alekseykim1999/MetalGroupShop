So this is where it began for Miles Davis. "The New Sounds" 
is pleasing on the ears as most jazz is, but it's the type of jazz 
album that you won't remember once it's over. There's only four songs, 
three of which are enjoyable and a fourth one that's rather dull. Still, 
if you want to know where he started, give this a try. You likely 
won't be all too impressed, but neither are you likely to be too 
disappointed.

In a vacuum, The New Sounds isn't a bad jazz record - 
there's too much talent here to make it anything less than pleasant. 
Still, I can't help comparing it to his later (and earlier) work 
and feel like Miles is just phoning it in. The arrangements are generic 
and the song choices are safe. You might expect Miles to shine on a 
slow groove like "My Old Flame", but instead it feels like riding a 
slow elevator to the dentist's office. Not recommended for any but 
the most devoted Miles Davis fans.
