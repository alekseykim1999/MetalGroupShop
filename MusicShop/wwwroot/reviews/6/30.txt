Tenor saxophonist Sonny Rollins was present as a member of 
the Miles Davis sextet (alto saxophonist Jackie McLean, pianist Walter Bishop, 
bassist Tommy Potter, drummer Art Blakey) on Dig, which was part of a 10/5/51 session, 
all of which was also on a two-fer. I love 
this music, but I have to admit it sounds dated. This wasn't Miles Davis' best, 
but I've always appreciated it for McLean's cutting sax work.
