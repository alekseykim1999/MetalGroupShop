"Blue Period", the third release from 
Miles Davis, is, as you would probably expect, 
is very similar to his debut, The New Sounds. And honestly, 
this should come as no surprise to anybody. Even if you were 
to completely ignore the fact that the album covers are exactly 
the same barring the colour and the text, the fact that two out of 
three of the songs here were recorded during the same sessions as "The 
New Sounds" should tell you everything you need to know. 
And when the third track actually predates the sessions for "The New Sounds",
 then it should be absolutely no surprise to anyone that Miles virtually 
created the same album; just another conventional bebop record. Completely 
inoffensive, very well played, but ultimately inessential and generic.

Honestly, I actually enjoyed this album quite a bit. I mean, that should have 
been as much of a surprise as this album being similar to his debut, but 
I honestly really did. I would even go as far as to say I enjoyed this more
 than The New Sounds (which I guess isn't unlikely, but still not exactly what I expected). 
I guess that this may have a lot to do with the fact that another highly respected jazz musician, 
Sonny Rollins actually performs on each of these tracks. I may not be too educated in jazz and haven't 
(knowingly) heard anything from Rollins' before, but that's a name I've certainly 
heard before, and hearing him play here really shows me why he is as well-known 
as he is. His performances definitely helped elevate this album even more, even 
if his playing (just like Miles') is fairly generic.
