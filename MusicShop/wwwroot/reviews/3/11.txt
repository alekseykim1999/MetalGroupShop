This single LP contains some of the best alternate takes that altoist 
Charlie Parker recorded for Savoy. Rejected initially in favor of other 
versions, these performances (when compared with the originals) show just 
how creative an improviser Bird was; most of these solos are radically 
different from the master takes. This material (highlighted by "Billie's Bounce," 
"Now's the Time," "Donna Lee" and "Milestones") has since been reissued on CD.
