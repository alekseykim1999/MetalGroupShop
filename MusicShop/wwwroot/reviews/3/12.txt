Now's the Time captures Charlie Parker during one of his peak recording periods. 
The personnel of Hank Jones, Al Haig, Percy Heath, Teddy Kotick, and Max Roach all 
contribute immeasurably to this classic session. There are numerous outtakes, which 
offers a fascinating analysis of Parker's improvisations, as well as classics such as 
"Song Is You," "Laird Baird," "Kim," and "Now's the Time." What makes this session extra 
special is the excellent recording quality that too many of his early recordings, 
brilliant as they are, suffered from. Hearing the clarity of each player contributes to one of 
bebop's best sessions. This is essential music.
