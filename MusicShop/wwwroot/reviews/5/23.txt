This Decca reissue (which was originally released on LP in the 1950s) features 
Ella Fitzgerald on a variety of mostly lesser-known performances from the 1944-52
period. In most cases she is backed by a studio orchestra although The Delta Rhythm 
Boys help out on "For Sentimental Reasons." 
Highlights include the title cut, "A Sunday Kind of Love" and "That Old Feeling." 
This material is currently available on CD.
