Mention the phrase "jazz singer" to almost any music 
fan in the world and chances are good that one of the 
first few names uttered will be that of Ella Fitzgerald 
(1917-1996). Fitzgerald was one of the few jazz vocalists 
whose appeal stretched across decades and generations, garnering 
both critical and popular acclaim. She also sang with Ellington, 
Sinatra, Basie, Louis Armstrong, and jazz guitar ace Joe Pass. "Sweet And Hot" is a 
reissue of a mid-1950s album presenting Fitzgerald at what many fans and 
historians feel to be the peak of her powers, with her amazing range, horn-like 
improvising, and gorgeous nuance on full display. This is essential stuff.
