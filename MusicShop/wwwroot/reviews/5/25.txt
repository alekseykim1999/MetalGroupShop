Ella Fitzgerald was accompanied by an orchestra arranged by 
Frank DeVol for this fine studio session. Most of the songs are 
veteran standards, Stan Getz's warm tenor helps out on four tunes, 
and -- although this is not an essential release - 
her voice was so strong and appealing during this era that all of her 
recordings from the mid- to late '50s are enjoyable and easily recommended.
