Ella Fitzgerald's Songs in a Mellow Mood finds the singer 
in the ideal and intimate company of pianist Ellis Larkins. 
A precursor to her equally stunning Gershwin set with the pianist, 
this 12-track set includes such first-tier standards as "Imagination," 
"You Leave Me Breathless," and "Until the Real Thing Comes Along." Presaging 
her masterful series of songbook recordings, Fitzgerald is equally at home with 
Gershwin, Porter, and Rodgers & Hammerstein, never faltering while she balances 
vocal power and interpretive nuances. 
Larkins only adds to the rarefied atmosphere with supple 
voicings of his own. A perfect way to soak up one of jazz's most 
glorious singers.
