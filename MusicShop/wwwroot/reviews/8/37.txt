"Dust My Broom" is a blues song originally recorded as 
"I Believe I'll Dust My Broom" by American blues artist 
Robert Johnson in 1936. It is a solo performance in the 
Delta blues-style with Johnson's vocal accompanied by his 
acoustic guitar. As with many of his songs, it is 
based on earlier blues songs, the earliest of which 
has been identified as "I Believe I'll Make a Change", 
recorded by the Sparks brothers as "Pinetop and Lindberg" 
in 1932. Johnson's 
guitar work features an early use of a boogie rhythm 
pattern, which is seen as a major innovation, as well as 
a repeating triplets figure.

In 1951, Elmore James recorded the song as "Dust My Broom" 
and "made it the classic as we know it", according to 
blues historian Gerard Herzhaft.[1] James' slide guitar 
adaptation of Johnson's triplet figure has been identified 
as one of the most famous blues guitar riffs and has 
inspired many rock performers. The song has become a 
blues standard, with numerous renditions by a variety 
of musicians. It also has been selected for the Blues 
Foundation Blues Hall of Fame, the Grammy Hall of Fame, 
and the Library of Congress' National Recording Registry.
