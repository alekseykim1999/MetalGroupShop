Normally I would just review the complete recordings, like all else, but I've 
got this right here and now, and I'm feelin' it.

I saw Robert Johnsons (il)legitimate grave, it was transcendent, 
I just stood there under a tree and stared at it, 
"here lies Robert Johnson" and all that blues. Inside the church 
next to where he's buried apparently there lived a woman until 
she died who could remember as a little girl serving lemonade to 
the men burying him. Cool I guess. I ate lunch with the judge, 
lawyer, town mayor, and town preacher who were all involved in 
the turning over of his estate to his illegitimate son, apparently there was a witness when Robert Johnson porked his mom... He bought a truck with some of the money, sat on the rest and continued to work his relatively dangerous construction work.

Anyone unfamiliar with the recordings of Mr. Robert Johnson 
should familiarize himself with them. These songs kick ass, and all them blues...
