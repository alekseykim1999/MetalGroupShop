Both sides were recorded on Johnson's first session on November 
23, 1936, in a room of the Gunter Hotel in San Antonio, Texas, 
which then housed a temporary recording studio of the American 
Record Corporation (ARC), a label group with Brunswick and Vocalion 
among others. As on the second recording session seven months later, 
ARC's record producer was Don Law, a native Englishman.

Although "Terraplane Blues" was only the seventh song that 
Johnson introduced on this session, it was selected for his 
first single, obviously with good reason, as it became a modest 
regional hit (selling about 5,000 copies) that made Johnson popular 
in the Delta for a time. A jaunty offering with several rhythm changes, 
it followed the basic structure of Kokomo Arnold's well-known 
"Milk Cow Blues". It does not belong to Johnson's most memorable recordings 
though, and its success may have been caused in a large part by the sexual innuendo, 
as the singer compares his woman with a Hudson Terraplane car model 
in various ways. Although someone else was "drivin' my terraplane 
for you since I've been gone" and it is obviously in a bad condition, 
he is confident that after several routine checks "your spark plug will give me a fire" again.

"Kind Hearted Woman Blues", in contrast, is a musically 
sophisticated recording with elaborate yet contradictory 
lyrics, very much under the influence of the urban blues of 
Leroy Carr and Scrapper Blackwell. It was the first song that 
Johnson recorded, and the first of the two preserved takes contains 
his only recorded guitar solo. Not exactly a typical example of 
the rural Delta blues, it was nonetheless included in the highly 
influential first Johnson compilation of 1961, King of the Delta 
Blues Singers, as well as "Terraplane Blues" which had the bonus 
of being Johnson's only hit.
