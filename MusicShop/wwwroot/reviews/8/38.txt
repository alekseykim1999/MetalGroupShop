"Sweet Home Chicago" is a popular blues standard 
for professional and semi-professional musicians and 
numerous artists have recorded it in a variety of styles. 
Steve LaVere, the manager of Johnson's recording legacy, commented, 
"It's like 'When the Saints Go Marching In' to the blues crowd".

In 1958, Junior Parker recorded the song as an upbeat ensemble shuffle, 
with harmonica accompaniment. Duke Records released it as a single, 
which reached number 13 on the Billboard R&B chart. Duke 
included a songwriting credit for Roosevelt Sykes, who recorded the 
song as "Sweet Old Chicago" in 1955. Neither Sykes nor Parker 
included a reference to California, a practice that is followed by subsequent performers.

On February 21, 2012, Barack Obama and Michelle Obama hosted, 
"In Performance at the White House: Red, White and Blues", a 
celebration of blues music held in the East Room of the White House.
 President Obama began by describing the origins of blues in the South and 
added "The music migrated north â€“ from Mississippi Delta to Memphis to my 
hometown in Chicago". Later, encouraged by Buddy Guy and B.B. King, 
he joined in singing the first verse of "Sweet Home Chicago".
