"Terraplane Blues" is a blues song recorded in 1936 in San Antonio, 
Texas, by bluesman Robert Johnson. "Terraplane Blues" was Johnson's 
first single and it became a moderate regional hit, selling 5,000 to 10,000 copies.

Johnson used the car model Terraplane as a metaphor for sex. In the 
lyrical narrative, the car will not start and Johnson suspects that 
his girlfriend let another man drive it when he was gone. In describing 
the various mechanical problems with his Terraplane, 
Johnson creates a setting of thinly veiled sexual innuendo.
 The guitar parts in "Terraplane Blues" are similar to those in Johnson's "Stones in My Passway".
