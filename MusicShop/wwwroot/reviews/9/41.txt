Five Live Yardbirds was the first important -- 
indeed, essential -- live album to come out of the 1960s 
British rock & roll boom. In terms of the performance 
captured and the recording quality, it was also the best 
such live record of the entire middle of the decade. 
Cut at a Marquee Club show in 1964, Five 
Live Yardbirds was a popular album, especially 
once Eric Clapton's fame began to spread after he left the band.
