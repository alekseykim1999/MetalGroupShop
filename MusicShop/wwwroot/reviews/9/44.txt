An exploitative album, released in 1966 shortly after 
the Yardbirds had their first American hits. This is a 
live show from late 1963, on which Chicago blues great Sonny 
Boy Williamson is backed by an extremely green Yardbirds. Yes, 
Eric Clapton is on here; no, he doesn't play well, managing some 
thin, extremely tentative solos that find him stumbling occasionally. 
It's really not that bad, though, as Sonny Boy himself sings well. 
But it should really be treated as a Sonny Boy Williamson 
release that happens to have a soon-to-be-famous-but-still-embryonic 
band in the background, in the manner of the sides the Beatles cut in 
Hamburg supporting Tony Sheridan. All of the material, and even some 
unreleased/alternate takes from the same dates, has since shown up 
on anthologies that are much easier to find than this instant collector's item.
