Back in 1965, this album seemed like a real mess, which was 
understandable, because For Your Love wasn't a "real" album, 
in the sense that the Yardbirds ever assembled an LP of that 
name or content. Rather, it was the response of their American 
label, Epic, to the band's achieving a number six single with the 
title track, with manager Giorgio Gomelsky selecting the cuts. 
The quasi-progressive 
"For Your Love," dominated by guest artist Brian Auger's harpsichord, 
is juxtaposed with hard-rocking blues-based numbers, almost all of 
which featured departed lead guitarist Eric Clapton (who is mentioned 
nowhere on the LP), with current lead guitarist Jeff Beck on just three tracks. 
The Clapton cuts, although primitive next to the material he was 
soon to cut with John Mayall, have an intensity that's still 
riveting to hear four decades later, and was some of the best 
blues-based rock & roll of its era. The three Beck sides show where 
the band was really heading, beyond the immediate success of 
"For Your Love" - "I'm Not Talking" and "I Ain't Done Wrong" 
were hard, loud, blazing showcases for Beck's concise 
blues playing, while "My Girl Sloopy" was the first extended 
jam to emerge on record from a band on the British blues scene; 
the source material isn't ideal, but Beck and company make their 
point in an era where bands were seldom allowed to go more than 
four minutes on even an album track -- these boys could play and make it count.
