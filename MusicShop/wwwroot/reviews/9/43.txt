In its original U.S. vinyl release, this album, 
comprised of several singles and B-sides plus excerpts 
off of Five Live Yardbirds, was one of the best LPs of the 
entire British Invasion, ranking on a par with the greatest 
mid-'60s work of the Beatles and the Rolling Stones; it was also just a 
step away from being a best-of the Yardbirds as well. 
No collection has ever outdone the sheer compactness and high 
quality of Having a Rave Up.
