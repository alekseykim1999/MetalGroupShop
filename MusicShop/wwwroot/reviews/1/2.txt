This recording was not only Louis Armstrong's finest record of the 1950s but one of the truly classic jazz sets. 
Armstrong and his All-Stars (trombonist Trummy Young, clarinetist Barney Bigard, pianist Billy Kyle, bassist 
Arvell Shaw, drummer Barrett Deems, and singer Velma Middleton) were clearly inspired by the fresh repertoire, 
11 songs written by W.C. Handy. Their nearly nine-minute version of "St. Louis Blues" -- with witty vocals, 
roaring Young trombone, and a couple of long majestic trumpet solos -- is arguably the greatest version of the 
oft-recorded song. Other highlights include "Loveless Love," "Beale Street Blues," and a romping version of 
"Ole Miss Blues." Essential music for all serious jazz collections. 
[Some reissues also include rehearsal versions of three songs, Louis Armstrong telling a joke, and a brief George Avakian interview with W.C. Handy.]
