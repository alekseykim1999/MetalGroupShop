Satchmo at Pasadena provides an enjoyable but incomplete presentation of Louis Armstrong & His All-Stars recorded live on 
January 1, 1951. The Pasadena Civic Auditorium concert found Armstrong fronting an edition of the All-Stars with trombonist 
Jack Teagarden, clarinetist Barney Bigard, pianist Earl Hines, bassist Arvell Shaw, Cozy Cole on drums, and vocalist Velma 
Middleton on two tracks. At the time of this concert, 
musicians began to take advantage of the new LP format that allowed them to bypass the usual three-minute 
time constraints of 78 rpm and stretch out a bit. Armstrong was no exception, and even though Satchmo is more of the 
ringleader/vocalist/showman on this set, the All-Stars provide some heated improvising, especially Hines on "Honeysuckle 
Rose" and Bigard's clarinet solo on the otherwise knockabout version of "Just You, Just Me." To properly capture what a 
well-rounded performance this is, it should be heard in its entirety, exemplified by the out of print four-CD compilation 
The California Concerts, which included the complete Pasadena set and a gig at the Crescendo club in L.A. the following evening. 
Since this reissue is an exact reproduction of the 1951 Decca LP, the songs are not only out of sequence but numerous tracks are 
comitted. It's too bad Verve didn't simply reissue the entire concert, which would have been preferable over the lavish 
attention paid to reproducing the original packaging.
