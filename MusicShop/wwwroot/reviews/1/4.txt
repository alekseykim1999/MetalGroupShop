Recorded in one marathon session in Hollywood's Capitol Records Tower, 
these two albums were joined together in a double-CD set in 1999, with new 
notes, repros of the original LP covers, and a liberal sprinkling of outtakes 
tacked onto each disc. That these once-overlooked albums have been given such 
exhaustive treatment -- at full price -- is a sign that they are finally being appreciated as prime 
samplings from the autumn of Armstrong's recording career. Even in the pressure cooker of a marathon 
session, even when confronted with standards not often associated with him, Armstrong finds the essence 
of each tune, bending and projecting them with his patented joie de vivre and gravel-voiced warmth 
every time. There are also lots of examples of his trumpet -- pithy, soulful, belonging to no one 
else -- although the index markings indicate that some solos are composite takes. While annotator 
Richard M. Sudhalter doesn't think much of arranger Russ Garcia's contribution, in fact, Garcia 
pulls off several charts for big band and/or strings that are among the most atmospheric ever 
accorded to Armstrong. In particular, "When Your Lover Is Gone" is sublime, with its signature 
riff of blas√©, sighing horns and responding, rising string tremolos, and Garcia frames "Body and Soul" 
with a lovely string chart whose penultimate stroke is a perfectly placed blue note. The strings of 
incomplete 
takes are particularly interesting, for they reveal the working relationship between Armstrong and Norman 
Granz, with Armstrong basically subservient to his producer. At their best, these albums create a 
seductive nighttime ambience that'll draw you in every time.
